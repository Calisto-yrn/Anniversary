                Every single moment with you feels like a chapter 
                from the most beautiful story ever written.
                 You've filled my days with laughter, warmth and peace that i never knew i needed.
            </p>
            <p>From the first time we met at inhurd even though i was so shy to start
                a conversation with you, i knew you were going to mean so much more than
                another person in my life. You've become my peace, my chaos and everything
                in between.
            </p>
            <p>I love how your smile lights up my world, how your laugh makes everything
                softer and how your heart feels like home. With every sun rise
                 I find a new reason to love you more than the day before
            </p>
            <p>As we celebrate our love today, know that i will always keep choosing you
                in every life, in every universe and in every heartbeat. You are my 
                favorite person and i am endlessly grateful for you.
            </p>
            <p>Forever Yours,</p>
